## Keypoints
- 游릭 There are 3 sale rounds
  - Seed Sale (Whitelist only)
  - Private Sale (Whitelist only)
  - Public Sale (everyone)
- 游릭 Each sale round has limitations
  - Max amount of tokens that can be bought **per wallet**
  - Max amount of tokens that can be sold **per round**
- 游릭 Tokens that haven't been sold in seed and private, will go to public
- 游릭 Tokens that haven't been sold in public, will be sent to the treasury
- 游릭 If the goals aren't met, the presale can be canceled and everyone can withdraw their contribution
- 游릭 After buying, you don't receive tokens directly. They are vested within the contract and you have to claim them manually after the sale is completed
- 游릭 The contract is built to ensure full safety for the investors
  - As soon as the sale starts, the configuration is set in stone
  - Liquidity will be added by the contract
  - LP Tokens will be locked by the contract
